The Golf Pebble Beach Storymap takes viewers on a journey through the different gold courses that make up the Pebble Beach Company. They created in total 5 courses that are all unique and offer a multitude of different experiences. The purpose of the sotrymap is to highlight the history of each course and key features that seperate them from the rest. I personally have played each of these courses and they are unlike any courses I have ever experienced.
